Natural finger flexion creates geometric displacement through
overhead tendon routing on the finger dorsal side.

Using Smith et al's tendon displacement equation:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta L_t = k_f \cdot \theta_f
\end{equation}
and substituting typical finger geometry data ($k_f = 0.8$ mm/degree for index finger), we then get approximately 24 mm tendon displacement for 30 degrees of flexion. Finally, this linear displacement provides the input to the transmission system.

\textbf{Tendon to Rotary Conversion:}
The tendon wraps around a drum connected to the ring gear, converting linear displacement to rotational input. Using the drum conversion equation:
\begin{equation}
	\theta_r = \dfrac{\Delta L_t}{r_d}
\end{equation}
and substituting our drum radius ($r_d = 5$ mm) and previous tendon displacement (24 mm), we then get 4.8 radians of ring gear rotation. Finally, this rotational input drives the planetary gear system.

\textbf{Planetary Gear Acceleration:}
The ring gear serves as input in an unconventional configuration where planet gears transfer motion to the sun gear. Using the planetary gear ratio equation:
\begin{equation}
	\theta_s = 12.66 \cdot \theta_r
\end{equation}
and substituting our ring gear rotation (4.8 radians), we then get 60.77 radians of sun gear rotation. Finally, this represents the 12.66:1 acceleration that enables significant blade extension.

\textbf{Pulley and Belt Transmission:}
The sun gear shaft drives dual synchronized pulleys with timing belts maintaining parallel blade alignment. Three blades are mounted perpendicular between the belts. Using the pulley-belt transmission relationship, the rotational motion is converted to linear blade movement with the pulley radius ($r_p = 3$ mm) determining the final extension.

\textbf{Final Blade Deployment:}
Belt movement translates to linear blade extension through the complete kinematic chain. Using the comprehensive deployment equation:
\begin{equation}
	L_b = 12.66 \cdot \dfrac{k_f \cdot \theta_f}{r_d} \cdot r_p
\end{equation}
and substituting all our parameters ($k_f = 0.8$, $\theta_f = 30^\circ$, $r_d = 5$ mm, $r_p = 3$ mm), we then get 182.3 mm total blade extension. Finally, this demonstrates how subtle finger movements (30°) result in significant tool deployment (182 mm).

The complete transmission system achieves:
\begin{equation}
	\text{Overall Ratio} = \underbrace{\frac{k_f}{r_d}}_{\text{Tendon}} \times \underbrace{12.7}_{\text{Planetary}} \times \underbrace{r_p}_{\text{Pulley}} = 12.7 \cdot \frac{k_f \cdot r_p}{r_d}
\end{equation}

Where small finger movements ($\theta_f$) result in proportionally larger blade extensions ($L_b$), making the system both responsive and precise for its intended applications.


This acceleration-based transmission represents an innovative approach to
exoskeleton tool deployment, leveraging planetary gear mechanics to amplify
natural human movements into effective tool operations.
